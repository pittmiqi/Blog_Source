Random Thoughts in English in comparison of Chinese (not in formal form yet, excuse for the
  grammar error and typo)

Think in more explicit way, have more
contents, visualize the world, objects, action, more explicit expression.
Imagine what is in the room, what are they doing, how do they look, what's the
relation between them, how to describe their looks, wearing, smell, so on.

Make what you think in brain more specific and tangible.
Assemble each piece of content and put in a logical fashion.
Chinese is in packed and condensed form compared with English. It is not rare that
there is a word consisted with over 10 letters in English. For the same amount of time of
pronunciation it can represent actually 4 words in Chinese.
English sentences needs be more dispatched to parts. and use more "small" words to link the different concepts.So it is quite critical in English to specify what the host is, what the object is and what
is the action in between.

How to compose a English sentence as native do? Using more noun phrase plays the trick.
In one sentence, there is only one predicate verb which indicate the main logic of the sentence.
So to link motion concepts, the way is pretty trivial, converting all other verb phrases to noun
phase in which way they can be part of sentence as attribute, complement,
adverbial clause, etc...

Why my English is not improved, because I don't have my thoughts in brain explicitly expressed.


When one develop their own native core code in brain, analogous to computer's operation systems level binary code, it is built primary in the infant age. The kids observe the world, develop their understanding of what's going on in the world, and attach these concepts to their "language". How to learn a second language, what I suggest to to revisit this process just as watching the cartoon or movies during their time of infant again and provide a second chance for learner to go though this process again. In this way, it is not fist language to second language type of transition, instead, the second language will be in the same position of the first language which directly link the native code of learner's brain.
